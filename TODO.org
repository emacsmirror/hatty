* TODO Shortdoc

* TODO Handle large raise display properties

* TODO Handle italicized text

* TODO Break up the svg rendering function

* TODO Handle selection of bold text

* TODO Fix some issues in ascent
Should be visible in the TODO face of this header.

* TODO Fix rendering for truncated lines
Because the final is not visible, it does not actually gain any
additional height.  In [[file:hatty.el::defun hatty--create-hats]], we do
not cover this case.

* TODO Correctly calculate drawing space for raised characters

* Testing
** TODO Get tests running again
** TODO Deduplicate text- and overlay property tests
** TODO Think about removing reliance on hatty-reallocate
This function is only available when hatty-mode is active.
Alternatively, I could just check if the mode is active in the timers
instead of this function.
** TODO Create visual manual tests
For manually inspecting rendering issues not easily testable in an
automatic fashion.  Show visual before/after, as in the previous TODO.
** TODO Cask for testing on different emacs versions
However, cask does not seem to be packaged for guix.
